# Punity

A tiny game engine with zero dependencies in C that I made for myself to make tiny games. It's great for game jams. It is also my kōhai course in simplicity and a tribute to my senpai and friend [rxi](https://twitter.com/x_rxi).

- Two files: `punity.c`, `punity.h` all ready for you to start working. (maybe also grab `build.bat` when you're at it)
- Approx. 1500 lines of C code.
- No dependencies.
- Produces a single executable with all resources baked to it.
- Images in PNG, JPG, PSD, TGA, GIF, BMP, HDR, PIC, PNM when used with `stb_image`. (see **Integration** below)
- Sounds in OGG when used with `stb_vorbis`. (see **Integration** below)
- Drawing bitmaps, texts and standard primitives all in software, this is *feature*, shut up!
- Sounds, fonts and bitmap API available.

## Speed

On an average machine, a game [33 grams](https://martincohen.itch.io/33-grams) utilizing previous version of Punity runs in 240x240 at ~20μs per frame (equivalent of ~50000 FPS). On [GCW Zero](http://www.gcw-zero.com/specifications), the same game in 320x240 runs between 0.7ms to 2ms per frame (equivalent of ~500-1500 FPS).

## Limitations

- Perfect for use with 320x240 resolution. No one will ever need more, anyway.
- Perfect for simple pixel art with only 255 colors (0 reserved for transparency)!
- No need to worry about 8 bits of transparency, because you just get one!
- Limited to 30 frames per second that gives you them retro feels!
- Fuck other platforms, **Windows** is where it's at! (see **Planned features** for more platforms)

There is another project I'm working on called **Blander** which is also quite small game engine that allows a lot of things that *Punity* does not. It's more bland, though. It's much bigger than Punity, multiple files aaaaand it renders in hardware,... shut up!

## Goals

- **Ready-to-go instant package.** No tedious external dependencies or fussing around with linkers: download, code and build from a single package.
- **Simplicity and minimalism.** Rather go for limitations than complexities.
- **Portability** Only get absolute minimum from the platform (window, input and drawing/audio buffers).
- **Optional additional features.** Plug & play addons for additional asset file formats, platforms or even scripting.
- **No arbitrary limitations.** All the limitations in the system have their reasons (performance, API simplicity). You might be writing a retro game, but the devices today have a lot of memory and computational power to use.
- **Two files.** Even though it's supposed to be a ready-to-go package, the essence is in two files that you can grab and use.

## Planned features

**Note that the project is still in development.** More documentation, features, examples and fixes is underway.

- **More drawing functions** very soon (`draw_frame()`).
- **Even more drawing functions** a bit later (`draw_line()`, `draw_circle()`, etc.).
- **Tile maps** (with support of loading simple Tiled format and with customizable Tile elements).
- **GIF recorder** to record the screen to animated gifs. Optional, because it brings a dependency on rxi's modified version of [`jo_gif.c`](http://www.jonolick.com/home/gif-writer).
- **Draw lists** to be able to push drawing operations in arbitrary order, but to get them sorted by *z* coordinate before rendering.
- **Live asset reloading** in *debug* mode while keeping the same possibility of baking assets to executable as it has now in *release* mode.
- **SDL platform layer** in an optional separate file `punity_sdl.c` with additional pre-made build scripts (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi, [Dingux](http://wiki.dingoonity.org/index.php?title=Dingux:About), etc.). This would introduce a dependency on SDL2, though.
- **Optional integration with Mason** (my other project) that provides single-file build system for C and C++ to replace tedious `.bat`/`.sh` maintenance with awesomely beautiful Lisp dialect from [rxi](https://twitter.com/x_rxi).

# Usage

Build is **working with MSVC or MinGW**.

1. [Download](https://github.com/martincohen/Punity/archive/master.zip).
2. Edit `main.c`.
3. Run `build`.

Build script is setup to compile `main.c` as single-translation unit, so if you need another C files, include them in `main.c` directly (same as I've include `punity.c` there). If you need something else, modify `build.bat` to you likings.

You can customize some aspects of **Punity** by changing macros in `config.h`, which is included automatically from `punity.h`. If you don't want this, use `#define NO_CONFIG` and specify the macros in any way you feel is better for you.

To use your own building script and project structure, just grab `punity.h` and `punity.c` and use them as you see fit.

Punity defines the `main()` function for you, but it gives you two other functions for you to implement as compensation:

- `init()` is called to initialize your own data, load assets, etc.
- `step()` that is called every frame; you update and draw here.

## Core

Punity also gives you a pointer to `CORE` (see `Core` struct in `punity.h`) to access canvas, inputs, timers, audio and memory.

The `CORE` is used also within the Punity's functions to make it a bit easier on passing arguments. For example, `text_draw()` expects a font to be set in `CORE->font`. 

## Memory

Punity provides two fixed-size basic memory banks:

- `CORE->stack` is used to store larger amounts of temporary memory. Typically it's used store dynamic in-function buffers that are thrown away when the function ends.
- `CORE->storage` is used for long term memory (like bitmaps, tilemaps, audio, etc.)

This way, no complex memory management is needed at all. Taking memory from the banks is just a matter of one pointer change (and a few optional assertions for you convenience). Should you need more memory, just change the `STACK_CAPACITY` or `STORAGE_CAPACITY` macros in `config.h` to use more memory.

Remember, you always know in advance how many entities, assets and buffers, so generally there's no need to use dynamic memory management.

Get `BankState` with `bank_begin()` to store current state of the bank. This is useful if you want to do more `bank_push()` calls and free the whole memory with just one call to `bank_end()`.

```c
BankState bank_state = bank_begin(CORE->stack);

f32 *channel0 = bank_push(CORE->stack, samples_count * sizeof(f32));
f32 *channel1 = bank_push(CORE->stack, samples_count * sizeof(f32));

// TODO: Do nasty things to `channel0` and `channel1`.

bank_end(&bank_state);
```

For simpler allocations, you can just use `bank_push()` and `bank_pop()`:

```c
u8 *canvas = bank_push(CORE->stack, CANVAS_WIDTH * CANVAS_HEIGHT);

// TODO: Draw naked women on `canvas`.
// TODO: Blend naked women in `canvas` to the `CORE->canvas`.

bank_pop(CORE->stack, canvas);
```

Asset loading functions like `bitmap_load()` store the bitmap data to `CORE->storage` memory bank automatically. You are free to change pointer to `CORE->storage` to any other bank you have. For example it might be handy to keep asset and state memory separate, so you can write and load them to file system separately.

## Assets

For tilemaps, images, audio, or other additional files, you can either choose to access the files directly, or to pack them with the executable. To do that, take a peek at `main.rc`. It looks like this:

```
Format:
<ResourceIdentifier> RESOURCE "<ResourcePath>"

Example:
font.png RESOURCE "res\\font.png"
```

Please, make sure you keep the first line `icon.ico ICON "res\\icon.ico"` in there, so your application and the main window will have a nice icon (that you can customize too!).

In the code, I usually define a `Game` struct that holds all the state and asset data like this:

```c
typedef struct
{
	Font font;
	Bitmap background;
	// ---
}
Game;

static Game game;

void init() {
	// To load from a file.
	bitmap_load(&game.font.bitmap, "res/font.png");
	// To load from resource.
	bitmap_load_resource(&game.font.bitmap, "font.png");

	// To use the font.
	CORE->font = &game.font;
}

// See the main.c for more examples.
```

## Drawing

To customize size and scale of the canvas, change `CANVAS_WIDTH`, `CANVAS_HEIGHT` and `CANVAS_SCALE` macros in `config.h`.

`CORE->canvas` is `Bitmap` struct that allows you to access the frame buffer at any time. You can either change the buffer manually, or use Punity's functions. See `punity.h` for detailed information.

- `rect_draw()` - to draw a filled rectangle.
- `frame_draw()` - to draw just an frame of a rectangle.
- `bitmap_draw()` - to draw whole or a piece of bitmap.
- `text_draw()` - to draw text using `CORE->font`.

Currently the drawing uses painter's algorithm (last drawn is on top). I plan to add `DrawList` feature so Punity will sort the draw calls by **z** key for you.

## Integration

Punity is prepared for use with [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) or [stb_vorbis](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c) to load images and audio files. The versions that I'm using are available in `lib/` directory.

- In `config.h` enable `USE_STB_IMAGE` macro. It'll allow you to use `bitmap_load` and `bitmap_load_resource` to load PNG, GIS, PSD and more.
- In `config.h` enable `USE_STB_VORBIS` macro. It'll allow you to use `sound_load` and `sound_load_resource` to load or stream OGG files.

## Debugging

You can run `devenv bin\main.exe` in case you're running from *Visual Studio Command Prompt* (or with `vcvarsall.bat` environment) to debug with Visual Studio. Note that you'll need to build with `build debug` to be able to debug.

## Building

- `build` - Runs build with defaults (debug version of MSVC).
- `build debug|release` - Runs build with MSVC, so you'll need to run `vcvarsall.bat` or Visual Studio Command Prompt.
- `build debug|release gcc` - Runs build with GCC (note that you need MinGW-W64 to compile successfully).

## Files

- `mingw/_mingw_unicode.h` & `mingw/dsound.h` - Provided for your convenience to be able to build with default MinGW installation. This file is taken from MinGW-W64 project.
- `lib/stb_image.h` - Optional library to load images.
- `lib/stb_vorbis.c` - Optional library to load ogg audio files.
- `build.bat` - MSVC and MinGW build batch file.
- `config.h` - Example configuration file that customizes Punity. Can be switched off with using `#define NO_CONFIG`
- `main.c` - Example application using Punity.
- `punity.h` - Punity's header file.
- `punity.c` - Punity's source file.

# TODO

A list of tasks I keep with important changes planned to appear in upcoming releases.

- Tilemaps.
- `draw_frame()`
- `draw_circle()`
- `draw_line()`
- Limit the number of audio voices.
- Palette rotations, shifting, etc.
- Experiment with a reasonable replacement of `StretchDIBits` to gain more performance.
- Animated GIF recording. Will need to solve the previous issues with it being too slow. Probably first record the frames to memory, then process the gif in a separate thread.
